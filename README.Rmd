# AWS CloudWatch Client Package #

**aws.cloudwatch** is a simple client package for the Amazon Web Services [AWS CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/awscloudwatch/) REST API, which can be used to monitor use of AWS web services.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. 

By default, all **cloudyr** packages look for the access key ID and secret access key in environment variables. You can also use this to specify a default region. For example:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1")
```

These can alternatively be set on the command line or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file ([see here for instructions](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)).
